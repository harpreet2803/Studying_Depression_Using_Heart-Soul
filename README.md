# Studying_Depression_Using_Heart-Soul

This is a comprehensive collaborative study on depression using multiple health and wellness datasets, including the Heart & Soul Study, NHANES, and BRFSS, focusing on self-reported, doctor-diagnosed, past-month, and past-year depression. My work emphasized advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering to extract clinically relevant patterns. Among several machine learning models, Random Forest achieved the highest performance, in detecting depression. In the Heart & Soul Study, which included longitudinal biomarker data from 1,024 patients (data is not public) over three years with follow-ups, I identified key biological predictors of depression spanning growth factors, immune, endocrine, neurotransmitter, and metabolic markers. To validate the robustness of my findings, I compared the results with publicly available datasets, NHANES and BRFSS, for self-reported depression, observing strong consistency across cohorts.
